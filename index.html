                <header>White Tea</header>
                <p>White tea, originally from China, is a minimally processed tea.<br>White tea comes from the delicate buds and young leaves of the Camellia sinensis plant from the Fujian province of China.</p>
                <p>How to make white tea</p>
                <li>Step 1: Heat the Water</li>
                <code>You want to make sure you are using good water for brewing this expensive tea. It’s best to use spring water or filtered water. Tap water will do if it has a neutral flavor.<br> Conversely, you want to avoid tap water sourced from wells, or water transported through copper pipes. Adverse water flavors may compete and overcome the delicate flavor of white tea leaves.<br>
                    You do not want to pour boiling water over your delicate tea leaves. This will ruin the flavor.<br> Instead, you want to heat water to just under boiling, 170 F. If you don’t have a thermometer, bring water to a boil, take it off the heat and let the water cool for around 5-8 minutes.</code><br><br>
                <li>Step 2: Measure Your Tea</li>
                <code>You want to use 2 teaspoons of Silver Needle (tea buds) for every 6 ounces of water.<br> Use 2 tablespoons of White Peony (tea leaves) for every 6 ounces of water. If your white tea comes as a combination of leaves and buds, as White Peony sometimes does, use around 1 1/2 tablespoons of white tea for every 6 ounces of water.</code><br><br>
                <li>Step 3: Steep the White Tea Leaves</li>
                <code>Pour water over the tea and let it steep for 1-5 minutes. Steeping time depends on your taste preference, with a longer time equalling a stronger tea.<br> Taste the tea at the one-minute mark, and sample it every 30 seconds thereafter until you achieve the taste most pleasant to you.</code><br><br>
                <li>Step 4: Pre-Warm Your Teacups</li>
                <code>This is a special step that enhances the tea drinking experience by making sure that tea doesn’t change temperature when you pour it into the cup.<br> Pour a small amount of boiling water into your teacups and toss it out shortly before pouring in the white tea.</code>

                <header>Green Tea</header>
                <p>Green tea is a type of Camellia sinensis tea that has not undergone oxidation during processing,<br>
                    Unlike black tea, as the leaves are picked fresh and after undergoing drying, they are pressed, rolled, crushed and finally dried.</p>
                <p>How to make green tea</p>
                <li>Step 1</li>
                <code>Boil the drinking water and allow to cool slightly for 2-3 mins, this slightly cooler water will get the best out of your delicate tea leaves.</code><br><br>
                <li>Step 2</li>
                <code>Pour the water onto the teabag to release its delicious aroma.</code><br><br>
                <li>Step 3</li>
                <code>Leave the teabag to infuse for up to 3 minutes. If you like a stronger taste you can brew a little longer but watch out, over brewing can cause bitterness.</code><br><br>
                <li>Step 4</li>
                <code>Remove the teabag and enjoy your deliciously refreshing Lipton Green Tea!</code>

                 <header>Oolong Tea</header>
                 <p>Oolong is a traditional Chinese tea that remains between green and black in oxidation, which gives it a characteristic bluish tone.</p>
                 <p>How to make Oolong tea</p>
                 <li>Step 1: Boil filtered water.</li>
                 <code>Oolong is best brewed in 185°F – 208°F water temperature.</code><br><br>
                 <li>Step 2: Warm up mug.</li>
                 <code>Pour some hot water into the mug and swirl it around then discard the water.</code><br><br>
                 <li>Step 3: Put 2 teaspoons of loose oolong tea into mug and add hot water.</li>
                 <code>Oolong tea comes in different shapes and sizes so it’s best to use a tea scale instead of a teaspoon. (If using a tea scale, put in 6 grams of tea.)<br>
                    I know how it’s a pain to use a tea scale if you’re not a hardcore tea person, so feel free to measure out 2 teaspoons of tea for each cup of water.</code><br><br>
                 <li>Step 4: Steep for 5 seconds and discard water.</li>
                 <code>We’re doing what’s called a rinse. It’s to wake up the tea leaves and start them unfurling.
                    After the 5 second steep, take out the infuser and throw out the water in the mug.</code><br><br>
                 <li>Step 5: Add 1 cup water and cover teapot. Steep tea for 45 seconds.</li>
                 <code>After you add a cup of hot water, steep it for 45 seconds with the lid on the mug. That’s it! Why only 45 seconds? Because we’re going to do multiple steeps.</code><br><br>
                 <li>Step 6: Take out infuser and drink.</li>
                 <code>A mistake is to leave tea in hot water for longer than the steep time.<br>
                    That’s why the infuser is great to have since you can take out the infuser and put it aside while you drink the tea.<br>
                    Keep the infuser nearby since we’re going to do a second steep after you’ve drunk your first cup.</code><br><br>
                 <li>Step 7: Steep tea again in hot water for 1 minutes and 15 seconds.</li>
                 <code>Once you’ve finished drinking your cup of tea, put the infuser with the tea back in and add another cup of hot water.<br>
                    This time, steep it for 30 seconds longer, totaling 1 minute and 15 seconds. Take out the infuser and drink again.<br>
                    Notice that the tea leaves have unfurled and they actually look like real leaves.</code><br><br>

                <header>Black Tea</header>
                <p> Black tea is a tea that is oxidized to a greater degree than the green tea, oolong tea, and white tea varieties.</p>
                <p>How to make Black Tea</p>
                <li>Step 1:</li>
                <code>Take some water in a saucepan and add sugar or cubes in water and cook on a medium flame for about two minutes,<br> while stirring occasionally.</code><br><br>
                <li>Step 2:</li>
                <code>Now as the water comes to a boil, add tea leaves and keep stirring on medium flame for about two minutes.</code><br><br>
                <li>Step 3:</li>
                <code>Now let the water infuse all the goodness from the tea leaves on low flame and cover the lid for about another two minutes.</code><br><br>
                <li>Step 4:</li>
                <code>Strain the black tea immediately and enjoy.</code><br><br>

                <header>Pu'erh Tea</header>
                <p>Pu-erh tea is also known in the West as red tea (in Chinese, 普洱茶; pinyin, pǔ'ěrchá) and its name comes from the Pu'er region of Yunnan China, where it comes from.</p>
                <p>How to make Pu'erh Tea</p>
                <li>Step 1:</li>
                <code>Rinse and warm the tea set using hot water. Simply pour the hot water into the tea pitcher, yixing pot, and tea cups. Swirl and discard the water.</code><br><br>
                <li>Step 2:</li>
                <code>Place tea leaves in the yixing teapot and pour a small amount of hot water on top. Use only enough water to cover the leaves. Swirl for 2 to 3 seconds and discard the water. Do not discard the wet tea leaves.</code><br><br>
                <li>Step 3:</li>
                <code>If you are brewing ripe pu-erh tea, repeat the rinse of the tea leaves once more. Raw pu-erh tea only needs to be rinsed once so skip to the next step if you are brewing raw pu-erh tea.</code><br><br>
                <li>Step 4:</li>
                <code>Fill the yixing teapot with hot water at 195 degrees Fahrenheit.</code><br><br>
                <li>Step 5:</li>
                <code>Cover the yixing pot with the lid. Pour a small amount of hot water on the lid.</code><br><br>
                <li>Step 6:</li>
                <code>After 10 to 20 seconds, the water on the lid should be dry. Once the lid is dry, pour out the tea into the tea cups. Enjoy!</code><br><br>
